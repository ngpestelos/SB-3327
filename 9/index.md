### Section 9. Right to security of data.

(a) The State shall, within its jurisdiction, promote the protection of the security of data for all persons.

(b) Any person shall have the right to employ means, whether physical, electronic, or behavioral, to protect the security
of his or her data or networks over which the person has ownership.

(c) No third party shall be granted access to the private data or networks of a person by an Internet service provider, telecommunications
entity, or such person providing Internet or data services, except upon a final court order issued in accordance with Section 5 of this Act.
It shall be a condition precedent to the filing of such action for access to private data that the person owning such data be first properly
notified of such a request by the Internet service provider, telecommunications entity, or such person providing Internet or data services,
and that such person has refused to grant the requested access. A person shall not be deemed to have been properly notified unless the person
has acknowledged the notification of the request for access and has agreed to grant or refuse access.

(d) No third party granted the right to access the private data or networks of a person by an Internet service provider, telecommunications
entity, or other such person providing Internet or data services, shall be given any property rights over the data being accessed, the media
where the private data is stored, the equipment through which the network is run or maintained, or the physical plant where the network
equipment is housed, beyond the right to access the private data or network, unless otherwise granted such rights by the courts following the
appropriate action and final order.

(e) No person shall be deprived of his or her device, network equipment, or physical plant that may be the subject of an appropriate complaint
filed in connection with this Act, except:

(ii) Upon a lawful warrant issued in connection with the appropriate criminal case by the courts in accordance with the Rules of Court; Provided,
that there must first be a determination from the courts that the data, information, or contents cannot be separated from the device, network
equipment, or physical plant; and,

(ii) Upon a final decision by the courts issued in accordance with Section 5 of this Act.

(f) The State shall be required to ensure the appropriate level of security of the data and of the networks, whether private or public, that it maintains.
Failure to do so shall be penalized by this Act and other relevant laws.

(h) It shall be unlawful for any person to compel an agency or instrumentality of the State maintaining data or networks to reduce the level of
security of the data or of the networks being maintained.
