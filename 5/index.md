### Section 5. Promotion of universal access to the Internet.

(a) The State shall, within its jurisdiction, protect and promote universal access to the Internet.

(b) A person’s right to unrestricted access to the Internet may, upon discretion of the appropriate Cybercrime Court whose jurisdiction is defined in this Act,
be suspended as an accessory penalty upon final conviction for any of the following criminal offenses:

(i) The felonies of robbery, theft, estafa, falsification, malversation, and usurpation of authority or official functions, as defined in appropriate
penal laws, committed by through or using the Internet or information and communications technology;

(ii) Any criminal offense defined and punishable in the following special penal laws: the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003 (RA 9208), the Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (RA 6713), the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001
(RA 9160), the Violence Against Women and Children Act (RA 9262), the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act
(RA 7610), the Child and Youth Welfare Code (PD 603), the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 (RA 9775), the Human Security Act of 2007 (RA 9732), or the
Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173), committed through or using the Internet or information and communications technology; or

(iii) Any criminal offense defined and punishable by this Act.

The right of person accused of any of the above offenses to unrestricted access to the Internet may be suspended or limited by the court of competent jurisdiction
pending final judgment upon a showing, following notice and hearing, that there is a strong likelihood that the accused will be able to facilitate the commission
of the offense so charged unless such order were issued.

(c) It is presumed that all persons have the right to unrestricted access to the Internet, subject to the parameters established under this Act. Any voluntary
restriction or waiver of such right must be established by preponderance of evidence.

Any final judicial relief that seeks to limit or suspend, in whole or in part, one’s right to unrestricted access to the Internet, shall be determined in
accordance with the appropriate law, including but not limited to the Civil Code and this Act. Any civil action that seeks as a relief, in part or in whole,
the limitation or suspension of a person’s right to unrestricted access to the Internet, shall be filed exclusively with the Cybercrime Courts.

No court shall issue any provisional Order suspending the right to unrestricted access to the Internet of any person without prior notice and hearing, and only
upon the grounds for the issuance of a preliminary injunction under the Rules of Court.

(d) The authority of the State to suspend one’s right to unrestricted Internet access is confined solely to the courts of competent jurisdiction and may not
be exercised by any government agency, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of law. The right of the State to infringe a person’s right to unrestricted
Internet access shall be governed by Section 5 of this Act.

(e) No person or entities offering Internet access for free, for a fee, or as an extra offering separate from the services already being offered, including
but not limited to any hotel, restaurant, commercial establishment, school, religious group, organization, or association, shall restrict access to the
Internet or any other public communications network from within its private network, or limit the content that may be accessed by its employees, students,
members, or guests, without a reasonable ground related to the protection of the person or entity from actual or legal threats, the privacy of others who
may be accessing the network, or the privacy or security of the network as provided for in the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173) and this Act.
