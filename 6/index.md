### Section 6. Right to privileged access to and control of devices.

(a) The State shall, within its jurisdiction, protect the right of a person to gain or attain privileged access or control over any device
over which the person has property rights.

(b) Any person involved in the wholesale or retail of devices may install, implant, or otherwise put in a device a component, a configuration,
or code that shall restrict the operation of a device; Provided, the installation or implantation is for the sole purpose of ensuring the
privacy or security of the interconnection or interoperability of the device with public or private networks or Internet or information
and communications technology infrastructure; Provided further, that notice is provided to potential buyers of the device of the presence
of the component, configuration, and code; Provided further, that the buyer may request the removal or modification of the component,
configuration, or code prior to purchase from the seller and shall assume all risks attendant to such removal or modification.
Removal or modification of the component, configuration, or code by any person except the seller, manufacturer, or duly authorized
representative may be cause for a waiver of the warranty of the device.

(c) Unless otherwise provided by law, any person who has property rights over any device may, by physical, electronic, or any other
means, gain or attain privileged access or control to such device; Provided, the gain or attainment of privileged access or
control was not intended to circumvent the protection of or cause the actual infringement on intellectual property rights of another person.
