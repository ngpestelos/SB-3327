(a) The State shall, within its jurisdiction:

(i) Protect and promote the freedom of speech and expression on the Internet;

(ii) Protect the right of the people to petition the government via the Internet for redress of grievances;

(iii) Protect the right of any person to publish material on or upload information to the Internet; and,

(iv) Not promote censorship or the restriction of the viewing of any content on the Internet, until after the issuance of an appropriate Order
pursuant to the provisions of this Section

(b) A person’s right to publish content on the Internet, or to remove one’s own published content or uploaded data, is recognized as integral
to the constitutional right to free expression and shall not be subject to any licensing requirement from the State.

(c) Any State action that constitutes prior restraint or subsequent punishment in relation to one’s Internet’s rights shall be authorized only upon a
judicial order issued in conformity with the procedure provided under Section 5 of this Act. Provided, that notwithstanding Section 5, any such
judicial order issued upon motion of the Republic of the Philippines, any of its political subdivisions or agencies including government-owned or
controlled corporations, shall be issued only upon the following grounds:

(i) the nature of the material or information subject of the Order creates a clear and present danger of a substantive evil that the state has a
right or duty to prevent;

(ii) the material or information subject of the Order is not protected expression under the standards of the community or the audience toward
which the material or information is directed; and

(iii) the publication of the material or the uploading of the information subject of the Order will constitute a criminal act punishable by laws
enumerated in Section 5 of this Act.

(d) No person shall be compelled to remove published content or uploaded data from the Internet that is beyond the said person’s capacity to
remove. The party seeking to compel the removal of the content or data has the burden to prove that the person being compelled has the capacity to
remove from the Internet the specific content or data. For purposes of this section, content or data retained in web archives or mirror sites are
presumed to be content and data that is beyond the capacity of the person being compelled to remove.
